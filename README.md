# bedrock-minecraft-server

Build & run

Save files into a directory: server.h, server.c, mempool.c, mempool.h, server_stub.c, main_objc.m, Makefile.

Run make (Linux with gcc) — the Makefile builds bedrock_core (C stub) and manager (ObjC wrapper).

Start the server: ./bedrock_core or ./manager.

# Performance & optimization tips (practical)

Use SO_REUSEPORT and spawn multiple worker processes (one per NUMA/socket core) to scale across cores with separate accept queues (Linux).

Use UDP batching (recvmmsg / sendmmsg) to reduce syscalls when handling many packets per tick.

Replace the mutex/cond queue with a lock-free ring buffer (e.g., moodycamel::ConcurrentQueue or a custom single-producer/multi-consumer ring) for lower latency.

Use hugepages for large world data and memory-mapped files for persistent chunks.

Keep packet parsing zero-copy where possible (parse in place), but be careful with alignment.

Use prefetch and data-oriented design: structure arrays (SoA) for entity simulation for vectorization.

Use SIMD (AVX2/AVX512) where heavy math (physics / block updates) is needed.

Profile with perf, gprof, or scalene and optimize hotspots. Always measure before micro-optimizing.

For production, consider running with ulimit -n raised and tune net.core.rmem_max, net.core.wmem_max, and kernel UDP buffers.

# Security & compatibility notes

Bedrock protocol includes handshake flows and encryption — ensure you implement proper validation to avoid being trivially abused.

For true Bedrock compatibility, you’ll need to implement RakNet (or adapt an open implementation) and the canonical Bedrock packet formats. Respect licensing if you reuse third-party code.
